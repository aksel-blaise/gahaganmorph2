\begin{abstract}
This investigation follows a recent morphological study of the three largest samples of Gahagan bifaces, and seeks to further characterise local morphological variation using 64 intact or reconstructed Gahagan bifaces from contexts where two or more specimens were recovered at the Gahagan Mound, George C. Davis, and Mounds Plantation sites. Gahagan bifaces are thought to have been imported from central Texas hunter-gatherers. Bifaces were scanned and analysed using the tools of geometric morphometrics to identify whether Gahagan biface morphology differs between and among Caddo features. Results provide a preview of the dynamic morphological relationships associated with Gahagan bifaces recovered from Caddo archaeological features. A preliminary sequence of geographic shape change is postulated for Gahagan bifaces that potentially articulates with modifications made by Caddo knappers, and not those of the hunter-gatherer groups thought to have manufactured them.

\section*{Gahagan bifaces}

\begin{quote}
The mathematical definition of a ``form'' has a quality of precision which was quite lacking in our earlier stage of mere description; it is expressed in few words, or in still briefer symbols, and these words or symbols are so pregnant with meaning that thought itself is economised \citep[720-721]{RN11532}.    
\end{quote}

This contribution follows a recent study of Gahagan biface morphology that enlisted the three largest samples from the Gahagan Mound (16RR1), George C. Davis (41CE19), and Mounds Plantation (16CD12) sites in the southern Caddo area (Figure 1) \citep{RN11783}. The results of that study indicated a significant difference in shape for Gahagan bifaces found at Mounds Plantation site when compared with those found at the Gahagan Mound and George C. Davis sites \citep[Figure 7]{RN11783}. The test for morphological disparity indicated that the sample from Gahagan Mound occupied a significantly greater range of morphospace than the sample from Mounds Plantation, providing limited evidence for discussions of specialisation and diversity. Morphological integration was also significant, meaning that those traits used to characterise Gahagan biface shape (blade and base) were found to vary in a coordinated manner. The results confirmed the supposition advanced by \citep{RN3684} that the assemblage of Gahagan bifaces from the George C. Davis site compares favourably with those reported from the Gahagan Mound site \citep{RN5274,RN2740}.
