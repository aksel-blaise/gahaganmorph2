  </ul>
  <hr>
  <h2>Version 4.1.7 (19/08/10)</h2>
  <p>A minor update.</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Reduced disk write access during MCMC analysis.</li>
    <li>Changed some variable declarations to static and made other code changes which should have no effect on operation.</li>
  </ul>
  <hr>
  <h2>Version 4.1.6 (08/06/10)</h2>
  <p>A minor update.</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Corrected a problem with the use of Question() within Sum display.</li>
    <li>Reduced disk write access during analysis.</li>
    <li>Dealt with outlier problem for R_Date nested in R_Combine where outlier probability was reported as zero.</li>
  </ul>
  <hr>
  <h2>Version 4.1.5 (19/02/10)</h2>
  <p>A minor update.</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Further minor improvements to the algorithm for finding a possible starting state for the MCMC before the burn-in period. This should help some models to run which failed to get started on previous versions.</li>
  </ul>
  <hr>
  <h2>Version 4.1.4 (05/02/10)</h2>
  <p>A minor update.</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Improvement of algorithms for finding a starting position (this should help some models to run which failed to get started on previous versions).</li>
    <li>Improvements to the diagnostics for failures to start.</li>
    <li>Bug fix for R_Combine used with the basic Outlier() command. In previous versions, this did not maintain constraints on either side of a flagged R_Combine in a sequence. The operation with outlier analysis is not changed.</li>
    <li>Inclusion of outlier status probability in the Agreement index. This only affects models where outlier analysis is used. If means that when a sample is an outlier the agreement index still falls (as when outlier analysis is not being used).</li>
    <li>Correction of a bug which could result in truncated D_Sequence distributions with extreme outliers under outlier analysis.</li>
    <li>Ranges no longer reported for Sum distributions (as these are misleading).</li>

  </ul>
  <hr>

    <li>Minor ammendments to the manual</li>
  </ul>
  <hr>
  <h2>Version 4.1.1 (03/04/09)</h2>
  <p>A significant update.</p>
  <ul>
    <li>The Question() function is replaced by the Outlier() function; with no parameters this still works in the same way; the old Question() function still works with the program.</li>
    <li>Outlier analysis introduced - using the Outlier_Model() function to set this up and then specifying Outlier(<em>prob</em>) with a probability for each item to be tested.</li>
    <li>Improvement to interpolation of depth models - allowing up to 1000 interpolations.</li>
    <li>Improvement to output of depth models - using the Raw view for the U_Sequence() or P_Sequence() this enables the age depth model to be saved in csv format.</li>
    <li>A new MCMC_Sample() function is added which acts like Order() but outputs all/selected passes of the MCMC to a tab delimited file.</li>
    <li>Plotting of the P_Sequence or U_Sequence structure on age depth models (if this option is selected).</li>
    <li>Ability to color distributions and calibration curves manually.</li>
    <li>Various minor bug fixes that caused crashes or failure to initialise models were fixed.</li>

  </ul>
  <hr>
  <h2>Version 4.0.4 (06/07/07)</h2>
  <p>A minor update.</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Bug fix to make program pick up prior files from the correct directory on the stand-alone version</li>
    <li>Bug fix to allow R_F14C dates to be used in MCMC models</li>
    <li>Modification to proportion of time spent in different components of the MCMC analysis - this should result in a slight improvement in speed</li>
    <li>Using whole range option now correctly reports quantile ranges (instead of the default hpd ranges) with MCMC analysis</li>
    <li>Plotting routine now correctly shows intercept ranges</li>
    <li>Plotting routine only uses axes for dates (not intervals or parameters)</li>
    <li>Improvement of window handling for Firefox</li>
  </ul>
  <hr>

  <p>A minor update.</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Added reporting of summary statistics (mean, standard deviation and median) for all probability distribution functions</li>
    <li>Added the calculation of distributions using the Difference() and Shift() functions, where the MCMC analysis is not used (as was already possible with the + and - operators)</li>
    <li>Fix of bug that prevented calcuation or probability-based calculations with a constant divisor or multiplier on the right-hand-side of an expression</li>
    <li>Minor change to the plotting routine to work better with the Inkscape SVG editor</li>

  <hr>
  <h2>Version 4.0.2 (25/04/07)</h2>
  <p>A minor update.</p>
  <ul>
    <li>R_Simulate and C_Simulate now report simulated dates as well as ranges</li>
    <li>R_Combine now rounds to the nearest year and rounds the uncertainty up to the next integer number of years</li>
    <li>Rounding of ranges has now been incorporated into the Web-based front end. This allows correct rounding for any of the date formats and merges ranges where the rounding results in abutting or overlapping ranges; the plotted ranges are not affected</li>
    <li>A number of bug fixes have been made to the web-based front end - particularly relating to the mixing of curves and some of the plot adjustement controls</li>
    <li>A bug correction that for dates reported as BC in the raw output/log file (not in the Web front end, or tabulated output) when resolution was set so that fractional years were reported; the BC date in the raw output was given as one year too early in these instances</li>
  </ul>
  <hr>

  <ul>
    <li>Minor changes to overcome bugs with long filenames and comments</li>
    <li>Fix for a bug resulting in incorrect axis scales on correlation plots</li>
    <li>Changed R_simulate to take into account uncertainty in the calibration curve (also implemented in versions prior to 3.3).&nbsp; This should be better for most simulations but will lead to excessive scatter when there are many dates within the same decade</li>
  </ul>
  <hr>

    <li>D_SEQ now works correctly with <kbd>ORDER</kbd> and <kbd>DIFF</kbd></li>
    <li>A bug which prevented the menu item [Options|Calibration curve] from being used from within a multiplot was sorted out</li>
    <li>Improvements to the manual: the mathematical parts should now print properly and there is updated information on the Oxford Radiocarbon Accelerator Lab</li>
  </ul>
  <hr>
  <h2>Version 2.17 (24/7/95)</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>No change in the calculations from v2.15</li>
    <li>Serious bug in Windows interface finally found - this made the program unusable on some machines with some combinations of programs. Unfortunately this problem never manifested itself on any of our computers - apologies for the delay in fixing this.</li>
    <li>The Y axis label on calibration plots has been changed from Radiocarbon date to Radiocarbon determination</li>
  </ul>
  <hr>
  <h2>Version 2.16 (8/4/95)</h2>

  <hr>
  <h2>Version 2.15 (14/4/95)</h2>

    <li>Posterior distributions in multiplots are now shown with italic labels instead of the `@' sign (this is optional).</li>
    <li>Reversing the order no longer changes the order of the calculations but only what is plotted in sequences; this was to clear up problems with multiple calibration curves.</li>
    <li>A few minor display related bugs have been eliminated.</li>
  </ul>
  <hr>
  <h2>Version 2.14 (8/2/95)</h2>
  <ul>

  <h2>Version 2.11 (4/1/95)</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Area normalisation on multi-plots</li>
  </ul>
  <hr>
  <h2>Version 2.10 (8/12/94)</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Uniform phases (<kbd>BOUND</kbd>) containing sequences are treated correctly</li>
    <li>Bug related to ordering of <kbd>FIRST</kbd> and <kbd>LAST</kbd> elements corrected</li>
    <li><kbd>ORDER</kbd> function reports a matrix showing the order of pairs of events</li>
    <li>Sums (<kbd>SUM</kbd>) are treated as phases rather than events - a sum of distributions gives a chronological distribution for several events and should therefore not be treated as for a single event.</li>
    <li>Alignment grid added to plots (optional)</li>
    <li>BP label added to radiocarbon date labels</li>
    <li>Options added for font style and size</li>

  </ul>
  <hr>
  <h2>Version 2.01 (28/9/94)</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>No change to calculations or modelling</li>
    <li>Program recompiled with some possible low level bugs removed</li>
    <li>Windows help file manual added</li>
