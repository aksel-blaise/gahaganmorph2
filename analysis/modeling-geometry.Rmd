## Modeling Geometry

This document includes supplemental materials for the article, "Shape difference or shape change? Inter-regional variation in Gahagan biface morphology." The study represents the first formal morphological analysis to assess inter-regional variability in Gahagan biface shape. In that study, two Gahagan bifaces, both from the George C. Davis site (4078-8, and 4078-72), were found to be missing small sections of the blade. This analysis limited the inclusion of specimens with missing data to those where the area of missing data was smaller than a dime (10-cent coin in the US).

Modeling was completed in _Geomagic Design X (Build Version 2019.0.2 [Build Number: 78])_. Due to the fact that each biface is unique, a unique modeling protocol was enlisted to reconstruct each piece.

All modeling occurred prior to the `auto3dgm` alignment. Following alignment, these two specimens were landmarked using the same [landmarking protocol](landmarking-protocol.md) as the unmodeled bifaces.
